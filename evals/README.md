These are files related to the evaluation of the model. I'd reccomend moving these to the directory above, (that way they have access to the 'model' directory

- eval.py Run evaluation of this architecture on a selected dataset, and compare it to a different model
- model_1.py -- contains the implementation of the mediapipe model
